Online image editor which uses JSManipulate effectively.

For those of us who don't know, JSManipulate is an open source library of image filters and effects and a premium jQuery plugin.
http://joelb.me/jsmanipulate/

I used effects provided there to built a web application using HTML and Bootstrap as CSS.

The user can choose over 30 different effects, for editing. A website would soon be created for the same.

More features are expected to be added, making it more robust.

*No loopholes at the moment.
